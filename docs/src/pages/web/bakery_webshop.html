        <p>
            This project was my first attempt at both front- and backend
            web application - development.
            It was part of the curriculum of a webdev class in the second
            semester during my undergrad studies at the U.A.S Technikum.
            <br>
            The class also introduced me to PHP, the language which turned out
            to be the first one I ended up using professionally for some time.<br>
            <br>
            The learning experience generated by the project turned out to be both a
            lot of fun and very fruitful in terms of gaining basic webdev skills.
            Although it was not a commercial project
            the amount of expected features were still covering all of the
            basics as one would expect from a serious webshop. <br>
