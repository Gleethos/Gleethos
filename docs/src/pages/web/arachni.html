            Arachni - A Java Webserver
        </h3>
        <p>
            As part of a software development class in the 4th semester of my
            undergrad studies at the U.A.S Technikum I wrote a webserver in Java from scratch. <br>
            <br>
            This must have been one of the most insightful projects I have
            done during my education. <br>
            This is simply due to the fact that the project completely demystified
            the modern day web-stack from the protocol level up to the frontend
            generated by the clients web-browser.<br>
            <br>
            This new insight was generated merely by implementing the
            http protocol and seeing it handle requests in action. <br>
            Besides that there were a great deal of design pattern involved in
            creating this little educational imposition.
            The most noteworthy of which is Arachni's plugin system
            which routes client requests to a given number of plugins being most
            well equiped to handle said request and generate suitable responses... <br>
