            Fovea - Fixed Foveated Rendering
        </h3>
        <p>
            This project represents my first encounter with
            the OpenGL API using C++. <br>
            I started the project as part of a computer graphics
            class in the 4th semester of my undergrad studies at the
            U.A.S Technikum. <br>
            Me and my team partner wanted to do something
            novel reflecting a current trend in computer graphics. <br>
            <br>
            Therefore our choice fell on Foveated Rendering. <br>
            This rendering technique can get extremely complex when
            implementing it for full deployment, however
            we simply wanted to pull off a MVP for demonstration and
            learning how to program shader kernels. <br>
            <br>
            We used a technique found in an interesting paper. <br>
            The concept we implemented takes the given vertecies in a
            scene and transforms them to a polar coordinate system which
            is then also modified by applying the log function to the radia of the
            vertices... <br>
            After rasterization we then simply apply the inverse
            (transform them back to the cartesian system) to the pixel coordinates and
            interpolate the pixels onto a new texture buffer. <br>
            <br>
            Traditionally this technique goes hand in hand with eye tracking, however for
            obvious reasons we did not further explore such features.
