        <p>
            This is the first full desktop application
            I wrote!<br>
            The project was built as part of the second
            software development class in the 4th semester at the
            U.A.S. Technikum.

            The application is similar to most other photo databases / viewers,
            except that I added a distinguishing feature, namely : Multi-Touch support. <br>
            Although the application is usable and stable, there are still
            many mocked aspects about the software that I will not finish simply
            because the application was intended as a learning experience and not
            a commercial product. <br>
