        <h3>Shogun - Board Game</h3>
        <p>
            This is the first desktop application I wrote
            having a graphical user interface.
            The project started as part of me trying to learn
            Java's Swing.
            It is a very simple little board game and
            it does not have many features.

            In essence the game is a digital port of a
            forgotten little vintage board game with the same name.
            <br>
            The rules are like in chess, except that the pattern by which
            a piece can move on the board is being determined by the number displayed on
            top of it. This number then changes after every move almost
            randomly, making the game less predictable and in a sense more fun
            because the outcome of a given game state can vary substantially.<br>
            The analogous version actually used magnets underneath the board
            to achieve this interesting effect.
