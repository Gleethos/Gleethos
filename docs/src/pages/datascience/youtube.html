            Youtube Sentiment Analysis
        </h3>
        <p>
            Take a look at
            <a href="https://github.com/Gleethos/youtube-sentiment-analysis">
                this project over at github!
            </a>
            <br>
            In this project me and my team combined data scraping,
            analysis as well as machine learning in order to extract value
            from the collected data. <br>

            It started as part of a data science and big data
            class in the 5th semester of my undergrad studies at the
            U.A.S Technikum. <br>
            Me and my team partner wanted to collect
            data directly from the most widely used video sharing platform,
            namely: Youtube! <br> <br>

            The most prominent technologies used: <br>
            - Pyppeteer for data scraping  <br>
            - Neo4J for data storage                 <br>
            - Spark for data processing  <br>
            - Sklearn and Matplotlib for analysis  <br>
            - PyTorch for sentiment prediction  <br>
