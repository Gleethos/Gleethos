                It discusses the current state of the art in the area of Deep Learning. It examines
                artificial neural networks with respect to the structure of their computation graphs as well as
                commonly used learning strategies in order to identify common architectural design patterns.
                The goal is to distinctly identify those architectural patterns which represent discrepancies compared
                to biological neural networks to investigate and uncover possible challenges in current
                state of the art design choices. On this basis conditional neural networks will be discussed.
                They are a special category of neural networks with the potential to overcome these challenges
                in the field of deep learning. Additionally the thesis discusses the challenges which are faced
                by current state of the art conditional neural networks. Furthermore a custom conditional neural
                network architecture is introduced which was tested on the discussed advantages and disad-
                vantages.
