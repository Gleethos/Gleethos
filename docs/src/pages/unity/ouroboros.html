        <p>
            Ouroboros is a 2D - Topdown story driven game I built with colleges
            during my second semester of my undergrad studies. <br><img style="width: 25%" src="src/img/ouroboros/plateau.PNG">
            This is the second semester project I did and also the second
            game I built with Unity. <br>
            <br>
            The game is mostly text based and the conversations
            that the player can have are generated based on the answers
            that were chosen... <br>
            <br>
            Ouroboros is currently an unfinished product simply because
            it was created as part of an undergrad semester project and therefore
            it is mainly a learning experience. <br>
            However I do plan on resuming this project eventually.

            The most exciting part of the project was the
            custom script parser used to read in text files that
            orchestrate a given scene. <br>
            The scripting capability even goes as far as being able to
            call methods of in game objects like the player character
            or items...<br>

            Another big part of the project has been it's
            core message and story : <br>
            Ouroboros revolves around the concepts behind
            birth, death and reincarnation.
            In a sense the game is a playable philosophical essay
            expressed in text and image. <br>
            The art style ought to reflect that :
