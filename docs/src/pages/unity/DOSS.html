            DOSS - Dungeon Of the Sleepy Stone
        </h3>
        <p>
            In my third semester of my undergrad studies of the U.A.S Technikum
            I joined a fifth semester project team developing
            a dungeon crawler game which we were then porting to VR
            and expanding it's features. <br>
            Besides refining my knowledge of the Unity game engine
            I also learned a great deal about developing for VR,
            especially the challenges of producing
            a good user experience or usability in general for such
            novel hardware has been extremely exciting and educational.

            The game is an unfinished product which is currently not in active development.<br>
            However me and my team plan on resuming its development in order
            to eventually publish it on steam. <br>
            The game started off as a university project intended
            as a learning experience and not as a commercial product,
            we therefore only managed to give it only so much time so far.
